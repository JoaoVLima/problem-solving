# lockers-problem
We got *n* lockers and the same *n* of students, the student *n* will open or close the lockers that are multiples of *n*. The sequence will go like this:

The student 1 will open every single locker, because they are multiples of 1.

The student 2 will close all the even numbers.

And we want to know in the end, what are the lockers that are open.
